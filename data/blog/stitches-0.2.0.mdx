This release includes one breaking change.

#### Insertion method

The `insertionMethod` config option has been removed.

})
```

## Bug fixes

- Fixed specificity issue with inherited variants & variants leaking as DOM attributes. ([#473](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/473))
- Fixed specificity issue when components would share the same style. ([#474](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/474))
- Fixed responsive variants not respecting usage order. ([#483](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/483))
- Fixed default variants being ignored when responsively applying variants. ([#492](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/492))
- Fixed flash of unstyled content after upgrading from alpha to beta. ([#523](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/523))
- Fixed variant props being passed down to DOM elements. ([#532](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/532))
- Fixed performance degradation after migrating from alpha to beta. ([#535](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/535))
- Fixed resulting CSS from custom `theme` / `globals` not appending if parameters were the same. ([#563](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/563))
- Fixed inconsistent use of `prefix`. ([#586](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/586))
- Fixed `backdropFilter` not transforming locally-scoped tokens in `css()`. ([#588](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/588))
- Fixed ability to set new default variants when composing components. ([#622](https://github.com/modulz/stitches/issues/622))

## Performance improvements

We've switched the style injection strategy to rely on CSSOM. This alone yielded huge performance gains. Additionally, we added extra layers of caching and memoizations. One way to demonstrate this is by rendering a component with the same styles numerous times and then checking the last render time. The last render should be faster than the first render, since its styles have already been generated and cached.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Sitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.2 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 34.78 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Initial injection

We've reduced the timing timing that it takes to inject the initial styles. This happens when a component is rendered.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 1.72 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 2.79 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating `css` prop

The `css` prop is useful for setting styles at the consumption layer. These styles need to be converted to CSS rules and injected to the DOM. This needs to happen fast - and it does!

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 1.06 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 1.46 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles

In this test, we render the Sierpinski Triangle. Each node is a different color, to ensure styles are dynamic.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 29.54 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 216.65 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Realistic page

Finally, this last test creates a full landing page, including responsive styles, tokens, variants. The test was based on the Stitches homepage.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 15.51 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 55.42 },
  ]}
/>
}

### In the open

Just like Stitches, our benchmarks are also open source. You can view the [repository here](https://github.com/modulz/stitches-bench).
