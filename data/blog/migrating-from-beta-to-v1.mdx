You can use this guide to help with the migration from Stitches beta to v1.

As we get closer to launching Stitches v1, we're doing one last pass at the API to ensure they're consistent, concise and that they won't change any time soon. As a result we're renaming some existing APIs and adding new ones.

---

## Breaking changes

The API is mostly the same, with a few small breaking changes, listed below.

### Renamed `defaultVariants` to `defaultProps`

This applies to both the `css` and `styled` functions. Note that `defaultProps` do not get inherited by compositions.

```diff
const box = css({
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: {}
    }
  },
- defaultVariants: {
+ defaultProps: {
    size: 'small'
  }
})
```

### Renamed `global` to `globalCss`

```diff
- const globalStyles = global()
+ const globalStyles = globalCss()
```

### Renamed `createCss` to `createStitches`

```diff
- const { css, theme, ... } = createCss()
+ const { css, theme, ... } = createStitches()
```

### Renamed `getCssString` to `getCssText`

```diff
- getCssString()
+ getCssText()
```

### Removed creator function from `theme`

The `theme` object can still be used to access your token data and reset your theme class. But it's no longer a theme creator function. Use `createTheme` to create a new theme.

```diff
- const darkTheme = theme()
+ const darkTheme = createTheme()
```

### TypeScript: Renamed `StitchesCss` to `CSS`

```diff
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react';
import type * as Stitches from '@stitches/react';

const { config } = createStitches()
- type CSS = Stitches.StitchesCss<typeof config>
+ type CSS = Stitches.CSS<typeof config>
```

### TypeScript: Renamed `StitchesVariants` to `VariantProps`

```diff
import { createStitches } from '@stitches/react';
import type * as Stitches from '@stitches/react';

const Box = styled('div', {
  variants: {
    size: {
      small: {}
    }
  }
})
- type BoxVariants = Stitches.StitchesVariants<typeof Box>
+ type BoxVariants = Stitches.VariantProps<typeof Box>
```
