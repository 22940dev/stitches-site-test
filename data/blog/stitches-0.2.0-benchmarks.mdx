We're happy to announce that Stitches v0.2 has has been released. This version comes with lots of performance improvements.

Available today via npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install @stitches/react@0.2.0
```

In this post, I'll share some performance benchmarks, and how Stitches currently compares with other libraries.

#### Caching

The first improvement is around caching and memoizations. One way to demonstrate is is by rendering a component with the same styles numerous times and then checking the last render time. The last render should be faster than the first render, since its styles have already been generated and cached.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9` and Sitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.17 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 32.24 },
  ]}
/>
}

We also compared against styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.16 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 0.21 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 0.16 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Initial injection

We've reduced the timing timing that it takes to inject the initial styles. This happens when a component is rendered.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.89 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 2.28 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 2.48 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 1.88 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing the variants is now faster than ever. Since variants can be conditionally applied, we ensure this happens as fast as possible.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.92 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 1.05 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 1.51 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 1.66 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating `css` prop

The `css` prop is useful for setting styles at the consumption layer. These styles need to be converted to CSS rules and injected to the DOM. This needs to happen fast - and it does!

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 0.72 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 0.81 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 1.73 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 1.63 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles

In this rest, we render the Sierpinski Triangle. Each node is a different color, to ensure styles are dynamic.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 29.54 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 216.65 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 65.72 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 65.23 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the styled-components benchmarks. Emotion also tests against this.

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 38.07 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 46.17 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 35.02 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 29.95 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Mount wide tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many sibling nodes.

Here's a comparison between Stitches `v0.1.9`, Stitches `v0.2.0`, styled-components and Emotion:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 51.25 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 62.82 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 47.76 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 43.6 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Realistic page

Finally, this last test creates a full landing page, including responsive styles, tokens, variants. The test was based on the Stitches homepage.

This test was only ran against Stitches `v0.1.9` and Stitches `v0.2.0`:

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches 0.2.0', value: 15.51 },
    { name: 'Stitches 0.1.9', value: 55.42 },
  ]}
/>
}
