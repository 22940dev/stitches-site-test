### Initial injection

The timing that it takes to inject the initial styles. This happens when a component is rendered.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 1.72 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 3.58 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 2.61 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Updating variants

Changing the variants is now faster than ever. Since variants can be conditionally applied, we ensure this happens as fast as possible.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 1.3 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 2.91 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 2.08 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: Since styled-components and Emotion don't offer a first-class variant API, this was done via prop interpolation.

### Updating `css` prop

The `css` prop is useful for setting styles at the consumption layer. These styles need to be converted to CSS rules and injected to the DOM. This needs to happen fast - and it does!

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 1.06 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 2.47 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 2.15 },
  ]}
/>
}

### Dynamic styles

In this test, we render the Sierpinski Triangle. Each node is a different color, to ensure styles are dynamic.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 28.79 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 73.42 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 66.29 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks). Emotion also tests against this.

### Mounting deep tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many nested nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 35.46 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 51.4 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 42.49 },
  ]}
/>
}

> Note: This test was taken from the [styled-components benchmarks](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/tree/main/packages/benchmarks). Emotion also tests against this.

### Mount wide tree

In this test, we mount a tree with many sibling nodes.

{

<BenchmarkChart
  data={[
    { name: 'Stitches', value: 46.03 },
    { name: 'styled-components', value: 76.26 },
    { name: 'Emotion', value: 62.58 },
  ]}
/>
}

## In the open

Just like Stitches, our benchmarks are also open source. You can view the [repository here](https://github.com/modulz/stitches-bench).

> Disclaimer: Our benchmarks compare against styled-components and Emotion. They're the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries and they've pushed us to improve our performance. This post has no intention to create negative competition between Stitches and them.
